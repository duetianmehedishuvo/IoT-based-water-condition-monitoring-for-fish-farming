### Title of the Project: IoT-based water condition monitoring for fish farming
##### Expected results:
- Obtain real-time data of different ponds water environment by using lot devices
- Dataset can be exploited in the Fisheries Management Information System (FMIS)
- Clouding real-time data for future prediction
- Machine learning models will be established for further data diagnosis

##### Experimental work:

Fish is vital to nutritious count calories in numerous regions over the world. In 2017, fish accounted for almost 17 percent of add up to creature protein and 7 percent of all proteins expended globally. In order to develop the fish farming, we will design an lot based pond water environment system to get the real-time dataset and these data have been saved in CSV format in the cloud server.

##### Hardware Setup:

IoT can be utilized properly by Hardware Setup which is an important phase. The following sensors are generally used for aqua culture environment:

- (1) Arduino Mega R3 PRC
- (2) Ethernet Shield
- (3) Temperature Sensor
- (4) pH sensor
- (5) Turbidity sensor
- (6) Conductivity sensor

##### Provide a list of key performance indicators for your project:

- Studying pond water environment for fish species
- Buying lot Sensors
- Ethernet shield & Arduino Microcontroller
- Implementation loT framework
- Programming for operation IoT system
- Connecting to Cloud Network
- Collecting Real-time value
- Preprocessing real-time value
- Using machine learning model for analyzing dataset for taking future decision of fish farming


#####  Relevance of the project to national development:
Fish farming in Bangladesh plays an important role in the total national income of this country. Bangladesh is a South Asian country, and there are hardly any areas in the country where the river or any other water source is not available. In a word, Bangladesh is surrounded by rivers and various types of water sources like ponds, streams, lakes, etc., and a major part of the total population of this country is directly or indirectly involved with fish or fish-related businesses. Fish farming has made a great contribution. Careful monitoring of water quality parameters is important to understand the interactions between parameters and their effects on fish and fish feeding, their growth, and their health. It needs to enrich the ability of aquaculture farmers to increase the productivity of fish. Water quality records will allow farmers to note changes and make decisions so that corrective action can be taken quickly. Our project research is very essential for increasing fish productivity.
